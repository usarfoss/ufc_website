/**
 * Which Redis database each kind of data lives in. Everything works with a single database (the default), and each extra database that is
 * configured takes a share of the load off it, so a free plan's command limit is per database rather than for the whole site.
 *
 *   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL / _TOKEN             the main database: the cache and the rate limiter. Required for Redis to be used at all.
 *   UPSTASH_REDIS_STATE_REST_URL / _TOKEN       optional. What the site must remember between requests (the live poll's notes, locks, who has
 *                                               to sign in again). Kept apart so flushing or filling the cache can never touch it.
 *   UPSTASH_REDIS_CACHE_2_REST_URL / _TOKEN     optional, and so on up to _6_. More cache databases: each cache namespace lives on exactly one
 *                                               of them (see CACHE_ORDER in cache.ts), so a read is still one request.
 *
 * Everything here is a copy of something that can be rebuilt, so losing any of these databases costs a few slow minutes and never data.
