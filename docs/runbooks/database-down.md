# The site shows errors, or is very slow, and it may be the database

_Last checked: not yet. Whoever follows this for the first time, fix anything that was wrong and put the date here._

## First, work out what is actually wrong (5 minutes)

1. Open the Neon status page and the Neon console. Is there an incident, and does the project show as running?
2. From a laptop with a `.env` for the **development** database, check the production database with its address given on the command line
   (it only reads):
   ```bash
   npm run db:ping -- "postgresql://…production direct address…"
   ```
3. Read what it says:

| You see                                                   | It means                                                                | Do this                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `connected` in a second or two, then rows                 | The database is fine. The problem is elsewhere (Vercel, Redis, GitHub). | Look at the Vercel deployment logs and [redis-down.md](redis-down.md).                                 |
| Connects, but only after 5 to 15 seconds the first time   | It was asleep and woke up. Normal.                                      | Nothing. If it happens all day, it is the compute hours (below).                                       |
| `too many connections` or `remaining connection slots`    | Too many instances opened connections.                                  | Check `DATABASE_URL` has `-pooler` in its host. Redeploy.                                              |
| `timeout` or cannot connect, and Neon reports an incident | Neon is down.                                                           | Wait, and tell members. If it goes past an hour, use [failover-to-standby.md](failover-to-standby.md). |
| Neon says the project is suspended or over its limit      | Compute hours or storage used up.                                       | See "Out of compute hours" below.                                                                      |
| Project missing or tables missing                         | Data loss.                                                              | Stop. Do not run anything. Go to [restore-database.md](restore-database.md).                           |

## Out of compute hours

The free plan has a monthly number of compute hours. When it is used up the database stops until the month resets.

1. In Neon, open **Usage** and note the number and the reset date.
2. Make sure the maximum size is capped at 0.25 CU (Compute settings), so a burst cannot use up 8 times as much.
3. Check the live poll is idling: `LIVE_POLL_IDLE_HOURS` should not be `0`, and the schedule should be `*/5` (`npm run jobs:schedule -- --list`).
4. If it has already run out and the site must stay up, use [failover-to-standby.md](failover-to-standby.md): the standby is a separate
   account with its own hours.

## Do not

- Do not run `prisma migrate reset`, `prisma db push --force-reset`, or the seed script against production, ever. They are blocked on
  purpose when `PRODUCTION_DB_HOST` is set.
- Do not delete and recreate the Neon project to "fix" it. You will lose the point-in-time history that might be the thing that saves you.
