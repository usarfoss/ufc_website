# Takes one backup of the database, proves it can be restored, and encrypts it.

#   needs:  BACKUP_DATABASE_URL  direct address of the database, using the read-only ufc_backup login
#           AGE_PUBLIC_KEY       the public key (age1...) the file is encrypted to. Only the matching private key can open it.
#           RESTORE_CHECK_URL    an empty scratch Postgres to test the restore in (the workflow provides one). Without it the script
#                                refuses to run, because an untested backup is not worth publishing; set SKIP_RESTORE_CHECK=yes to say

#   makes:  out/ufc-<time>.dump.age   (and leaves out/ufc-<time>.dump next to it for the steps that follow; delete it afterwards)
#
# What "proves it can be restored" means: the dump is loaded into a scratch database and the number of rows in every table is compared with
# the live database. A backup that cannot be restored is worse than none, because you believe you have one.
#
# The check fails (and so does the backup) if a count query fails, if no tables were counted, if the live database does not have the club's
# core tables, or if the restored copy does not have exactly the same tables as the live one.
